The folder 'Initial_ODF' contains 76 Orientation Distribution Functions (ODFs) represented in Rodrigues orientation space. These ODFs define various FCC microstructures, each subjected to five different processing conditions: tension and plane strain compression along the X direction, and shear in the XY, XZ, and YZ planes.

The corresponding final ODFs are stored in the 'Final_ODF' folder, following the same naming convention as the initial ODFs.

Additionally, the folder 'Initial_and_Final_C' contains Excel files listing the initial and final stiffness components, assuming INCONEL 718 as the base material, following the same naming convention as the initial ODFs.
